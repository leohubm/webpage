title: "Digital Sentiment Analysis for Quantitative Bitcoin Trading"
description: "Bitcoin is characterized by extreme volatility, speculative investor behaviour, and significant price move-ments, often occurring without clear fundamental drivers (Baur et al., 2018; Kyriazis et al., 2020). Quantita-tive trading approaches typically rely on historical price patterns and technical indicators, but cryptocurrency markets present unique challenges due to their sensitivity to sentiment and investor emotions.
Research by Almeida and Gonçalves (2023) demonstrates that investor sentiment, herd behaviour, and news significantly impact cryptocurrency prices, with investor attention being a key factor driving decisions in these markets. This suggests that incorporating sentiment analysis into trading strategies could potentially enhance their effectiveness, particularly for capturing short term market dynamics in Bitcoin trading.
However, effectively applying sentiment analysis to Bitcoin trading presents multiple challenges. These in-clude accurately extracting sentiment from noisy textual data, quantifying the sentiment meaningfully, and practically integrating these signals into actionable trading strategies (Kraaijeveld & De Smedt, 2020). Addi-tionally, uncertainty remains regarding which sentiment extraction methods perform best for cryptocurrency markets, how sentiment signals influence trading performance in practice, and whether sentiment-based ap-proaches actually contribute to superior alpha generation (Garcia & Schweitzer, 2015; Vidal-Tomás et al., 2019).
Despite the growing interest in sentiment analysis for financial markets, a systematic exploration of senti-ment driven Bitcoin trading strategies remains limited. Existing research has primarily focused on establish-ing correlations between sentiment and price movements rather than developing and testing practical trading implementations.
